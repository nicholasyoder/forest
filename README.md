# Forest

Forest is a desktop environment built with C++ and Qt

It is to the point that I use it on all my linux machines, but there are still numerous things that have bugs - expecially if it something that I don't use in my normal workflow.

By default it uses the xfwm4 window manager, and the lxsession session manager. I would like to write my own for each of these as well, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
